# Create a function that takes a string and returns a new string with its first and last characters swapped, except  under three conditions: 
# If the length of the string is less than two, return "Incompatible.". 
# If the argument is not a string, return "Incompatible.". 
# If the first and last characters are the same, return "Two's a pair.". 
# Examples 
# flip_end_chars("Cat, dog, and mouse.") ➞ ".at, dog, and mouseC" 
# flip_end_chars("ada") ➞ "Two's a pair." 
# flip_end_chars("Ada") ➞ "adA" 
# flip_end_chars("z") ➞ "Incompatible." 
# flip_end_chars([1, 2, 3]) ➞ "Incompatible."
